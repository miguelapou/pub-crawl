# CRWL

## Approach

We wanted a way to bring people together not just online but in person. Drinks are always a good motivator but why not take it one step further and turn it into an adventure? Thus CRWL was born. A way to look at journeys happening within your city that you can join in on either from from the beginning, or pop in and out at your leisure. Wether you're meeting up with friends or jumping into the unknown and meeting new ones, you're bound to have a great time.
